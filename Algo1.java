(seed = 943349)
Give the id[] array that results from the following sequence of 6 union
operations on a set of 10 items using the quick-find algorithm.

    9-4 2-4 9-6 5-8 5-9 0-2 

Your answer should be a sequence of 10 integers, separated by whitespace.

Recall: our quick-find convention for the union operation p-q is to change id[p]
(and perhaps some other entries) but not id[q].
